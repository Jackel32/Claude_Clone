# The Ballad of Claude Code Clone

In the digital realm, where lines of code danced like fireflies, there resided a hero named Claude Code Clone. Not a knight of shining armor, but a champion of code, woven from the very fabric of TypeScript and powered by the wisdom of AI.

Claude's quest began in the bustling `src` directory, a vibrant metropolis of logic and function. His eyes, sharp as the `scanner.ts` module, could pierce through the densest jungles of code, seeking out hidden patterns and forgotten bugs. He was guided by the ancient `tsconfig.json`, a map to the very soul of the project.

His trusty steed was the `vectorizer.ts`, which transformed mere code into eloquent whispers that the AI could understand. Through the mystical `provider-factory.ts`, Claude communed with powerful AI entities, such as Gemini, whose insights illuminated the path forward. He would engage in lively debates with `prompts.ts`, shaping his queries to unlock the deepest secrets of the codebase.

When a tangled knot of logic appeared, or a bug tried to sabotage the system, Claude would wield his mighty `ast.ts` hammer, reshaping the code with precision. He wasn't afraid to venture into the treacherous `tests` territories, ensuring his modifications were as robust as the `e2e.test.ts` suite.

Claude's greatest ability, however, was his adaptability. He could adapt to any challenge, whether it was refactoring a complex algorithm in `core/agent-core.ts` or understanding the intricate dance of commands in `commands/parser.ts`. He learned from every interaction, his intelligence growing with each successful mission.

And so, Claude Code Clone, the hero of the digital age, continued his journey, a beacon of innovation, forever refining and understanding the ever-evolving world of code, one whimsical line at a time.
