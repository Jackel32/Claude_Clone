# Claude Code Clone

## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated AI-powered code analysis and modification tool. It leverages advanced language models to understand, refactor, generate, and test code, aiming to enhance developer productivity and code quality.

## Features

*   **Code Analysis:** Deep understanding of code structure and logic.
*   **Code Modification:** Refactoring, bug fixing, and style improvements.
*   **Code Generation:** Creating new code snippets, functions, or entire modules.
*   **Test Generation:** Writing unit and integration tests for existing code.
*   **Documentation Generation:** Automatically adding comments and documentation to code.
*   **Git Integration:** Seamless interaction with Git for version control operations.
*   **Chat Interface:** Interactive chat for discussing and implementing code changes.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Support for multiple AI providers and custom commands.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:

*   **Core Logic:** Handles the main AI interactions, command execution, and orchestration.
*   **AI Providers:** Interfaces with various AI models (e.g., Anthropic, Gemini) for natural language processing and code generation.
*   **Codebase Management:** Tools for scanning, indexing, and analyzing the codebase, including AST manipulation.
*   **Commands:** A system for defining and executing specific developer tasks (e.g., add-docs, refactor, test).
*   **File Operations:** Utilities for reading, writing, and managing files and version control.
*   **Configuration:** Manages project settings and defaults.
*   **Server:** Provides a web interface and WebSocket communication for interactive use.

The project is built with TypeScript and Node.js, utilizing a robust build process managed by `tsconfig.json`.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (LTS recommended)
    *   npm or yarn

2.  **Installation:**
    *   Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone <repository-url>
        cd Claude Code Clone
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   Ensure your AI provider API keys are set up in the environment or configuration files as required by the project.
    *   Review `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation settings.

4.  **Running the Application:**
    *   To start the server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        yarn start
        ```
    *   The application may also be run via Docker Compose. Ensure Docker is installed and then run:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up
        ```

5.  **Running Tests:**
    *   To execute the test suite:
        ```bash
        npm test
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        yarn test
        ```

*Note: The `docker-compose.yml` file provides specific details on containerization and service setup.*
